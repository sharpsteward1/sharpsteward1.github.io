    <li>the categories and sources of the personal information that we collect about you, the purposes for which we use your information and with whom such information is shared;</li>

        for sales, the personal information categories purchased by each category of recipient; and
        for disclosures for a business purpose, the personal information categories obtained by each category of recipient.
        The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal information collected or used over the past 12 months.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed will be "portable", i.e. delivered in an easily usable format to enable you to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance – provided that this is technically feasible.</p>

<p><strong>10.13 The right to request the deletion of your personal information</strong><br>
    You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors on this Application, to detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to exercise certain rights etc.).</p>

<p>If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right, we will delete your personal information and direct any of our service providers to do so.</p>

<p><strong>10.14How to exercise your rights</strong><br>
    To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided in this Policy.</p>

<p>For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you are. Therefore, you can only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:</p>

<ul>
    <li>provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;</li>
    <li>describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
        We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to you.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.</p>

<p>If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a minor under your parental authority.</p>

<p>You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.</p>

<p>Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12 month period.</p>

<p>Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.</p>

<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. In either case, we will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.</p>
